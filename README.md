## About

Data comes in many shapes and sizes. Storing all data types as strings would be very inefficient in trytes. That is where this module comes in. Whether it be strings, numbers, boolean, arrays, dates, etc. This module aims to encode the data to trytes and also bring it back to it's original type and value.

## Supported Encodings
- [x] String
- [x] 8-bit Integer [-128 to 127]
- [x] 16-bit Integer [-32,768 to 32,767]
- [x] 32-bit Integer [-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647]
- [ ] 64-bit Integer
- [x] 8-bit Unsigned Integer [0 to 255]
- [x] 16-bit Unsigned Integer [0 to 65,535]
- [x] 32-bit Unsigned Integer [0 to 4,294,967,295]
- [ ] 64-bit Unsigned Integer
- [x] Boolean
- [x] DateUTC
- [x] Geospatial Coordinates
- [x] Array<supported>

## Install
```sh
# npm
npm install --save tryte-encode-decode

# yarn
yarn add tryte-encode-decode
```

## Example
```js
// import package
// ES5
const tryteConverter = require('@iftt/tryte-encode-decode');

import tryteConverter from '@iftt/tryte-encode-decode';

let trytes = tryteConverter.stringToTrytes('This is a test.');
let decodedTrytes = tryteConverter.trytesToString(trytes);

// decodedTrytes === 'This is a test.'
```
